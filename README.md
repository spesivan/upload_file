# What does this bot do?

With this bot, **you can choose to upload, list or even both your non-fungible tokens** on the OpenSea marketplace.  

You just have to **create a metadata file** following the requested structure, JSON, CSV and XLSX (Excel file) formats are available.  
This file will include every detail for each NFT.  
Then, you just have to **launch the bot** and **select the action you want to perform**, as well as the metadata file created.  
Finally, **the bot will automate the tedious task of uploading or listing NFTs, one by one by hand, for several days**.  

* Absolutely **all upload details are supported**, you can add as many properties as you want.
* **All file formats** offered by OpenSea **are compatible**, including images, videos or even 3D models.
* **Ethereum and Polygon blockchains are supported**, and the switch between these two blockchains is also supported.
* In case of failure during an upload, a listing or when you only want to upload your NFTs on OpenSea, **a file is generated with details already filled** in or to be filled in.

You can see an example of collections transferred with this bot:
* **[Crypto Parrot](https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-parrot-nfts)**, transferred and listed before reCAPTCHAs.
* **[Rainbow Color Gradients](https://opensea.io/collection/rainbow-color-gradient)**, transferred and listed using the reCAPTCHA Bypasser.


# Frequently asked questions

### Should I be worried about using my wallet credentials?

According to **Rule #1** of the MetaMask "Safety Tips", it is requested to "**Never share your 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) or private keys**". However, your wallet credentials are **only used** for the purpose of connecting to your wallet extension. The bot follows the procedure for the first connection to a wallet on a new browser (importing from a recovery phrase followed by creating a new password). Thus, none of this information is recovered, everything happens on your side. Moreover, you are free to choose whether or not to save your credentials in text files in the `assets/` folder.

### Which reCAPTCHA solver is the best?

It all depends on your choices and the equipment you have.
* If you have a powerful computer (running Windows or Linux) and you don't want to pay for a paid service, you should choose option number 2: the reCAPTCHA solver with Yolov5x6.
* If you don't have a powerful computer but don't mind paying for a service, you have 2 solutions.
  * The first one is option number 3 ([2Captcha](https://2captcha.com?from=13853725)) which is convenient if you want to upload a small collection at an affordable price.
  * The second option is option number 4 ([reCAPTCHA Bypasser](#recaptcha-bypasser)) which, in addition to speeding up the upload speed, allows you to upload as many collections as you want.
* If your computer is not powerful enough and you don't want to pay, choose the first option: manual resolution.

### Is there an easy way to get the URLs of already uploaded NFTs?

A tool to retrieve URLs from NFTs is available. You can learn more about this tool [here](#collection-scraper).

### How to find missing and duplicates NFTs in my collection?

A tool to extract NFTs to get the missing and duplicates is available. You can learn more about this tool [here](#collection-scraper).
Then if you want to remove duplicates, you can use this tool [here](#deletion).

### Is there a quick way to create my metadata file?

A tool to generate a complete metadata file from a single file is available. You can learn more about this tool [here](#generic-file-maker).

### I'm coming from the Hashlips Art Engine tool, how to make my files compatible?

You have just generated your images and associated metadata but notice that these files are not compatible with this tool. Well, don't worry! Two tools will allow you to transform these files into one complete file compatible with this tool.
- The [File Compatibilizer and Converter](#file-compatibilizer-and-converter) will transform your files into a single compatible file.
- However, some essential information is missing from this file. For example, if you want to add the price, the duration of the sale or the path to the generated images, videos or 3D objects, you will need the [Generic File Maker](#generic-file-maker).

**Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSqIqbuFnn0) on YouTube, it explains step by step the process to convert and fill your metadata file.**

# Metadata files structure

**➜ In addition, watch this video on YouTube: [How to create my metadata file?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67eRggoadOQ)**  
**➜ Easily generate your metadata file using this [tool](#generic-file-maker).**

## Important things to know

* If you do not want to add details to the values not required (**all details are required**), leave:
  * **a blank cell** for XLSX files (Excel):
    <table>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td>File Path</td>
       <td>NFT Name</td>
       <td>Description</td>
      </tr>

  * **a white space with two semicolons** for CSV files:
    ```csv
    file_path;; nft_name;; description;;
    C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/NFT/nft_0001.png;; NFT #1;; ;;
    ```
  * **an empty string** for JSON files: 
    ```json
    "file_path": "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/NFT/nft_0001.png",
    "nft_name": "NFT #1",
    "description": "",
    ```

* **The file path should not contain a unique "\\". It can be a "/" or a "\\\\", as you can see for the JSON file *(it applies to all file formats)*:**
  
  ```json
  // You can use this format for your path:
  "file_path": "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/MyNFTs/nft_0001.png",
  // or this one:
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\MyNFTs\\nft_0001.png",
  // but not this one (you can see that "\" is highlighted in red):
  "file_path": "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\MyNFTs\nft_0001.png",
  ```

* <strong>Required values *</strong>
* Mandatory value in certain specified cases are in brackets
  
</details>

## "Upload and sale" metadata file

When you want to sell your NFTs, Opensea requires various details according to their Blockchain or supply number.  
**Note: The maximum duration of sale should be at most 6 months.**  

Make sure to **deposit Ethereum (ETH/WETH)** or **Polygon (MATIC)** on your wallet before proceeding to the sale. Otherwise the bot will cancel the sale. Opensea needs an **Ethereum** wallet with more than **0.05 ETH** or a **Polygon** wallet with a deposit of **any amount**. For **Ethereum**, you have to make a first listing manually before using this bot.

## "Sale only" metadata file

If you have already uploaded your NFTs with this bot, a file has been generated containing the URL, the Blockchain and the supply number of each NFT. You have to complete it with sale values.
  
When you want to sell your NFTs, Opensea requires various details according to their Blockchain or supply number.  
**Note: The maximum duration of sale should be at most 6 months.**  

Make sure to **deposit Ethereum (ETH/WETH)** or **Polygon (MATIC)** on your wallet before proceeding to the sale. Otherwise the bot will cancel the sale. Opensea needs an **Ethereum** wallet with more than **0.05 ETH** or a **Polygon** wallet with a deposit of **any amount**. For **Ethereum**, you have to make a first listing manually before using this bot.

# Useful tools to have for this bot

All these tools are not free and are only add-ons. You can still use the bot without these tools.

## Collection Scraper

[![Collection Scraper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91475935/166142344-cd0bd61e-6ea5-45fc-bdd6-a007c991ed19.png)](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-collection-scraper)

With this OpenSea collection scraper, you can retrieve the entire URLs of the NFTs of a collection automatically.  
It facilitates the listing of NFTs already uploaded to OpenSea before, without the help of the latter.  

The bot takes care of sorting among the NFTs by creating different files compatible with the "Sale only" part of the bot.  
Thus a "**full**" file containing all NFTs, a "**unique**" file containing each NFT individually based on their names, a "**duplicate**" file containing all duplicated NFTs of the collection and a "**missing**" file containing all missing NFTs will be created, and these in all formats compatible with the bot (JSON, CSV and XLSX).  
**Purchase this tool - [Collection Scraper](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-collection-scraper).**

[![Deletion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91475935/167246640-f4a7764f-37ae-46e6-9d5a-91b100eb6d1c.png)](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-deletion)

With this Deletion tool, you can massively remove NFTs from your account. All you have to do is create a file containing the URL of the NFTs you want to delete, then launch the main bot and select the fourth option. It is even easier if you have the [Collection Scraper](#collection-scraper) tool, which automatically creates a file compatible with this tool.

### Installation and run the bot

* **Make sure you have version 1.7.5 or higher.**
* Extract the file from the ZIP file, you should have a file named `delete.py`.
* Navigate to the "Upload and Sale" bot repository, and place this file in this directory: `opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/app/services/processes/delete.py`.
* Start the main bot and at action select the 4th option.
  
### File structure

**This works exactly like a "Sale Only" file where only the first value will be taken into account (`nft_url`).**

<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Details</td>
         <td>Data Types</td>
         <td>Literal examples</td>
         <td>JSON examples</td>
         <td>CSV examples</td>
         <td>XLSX examples</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><strong>NFT URL * </strong></td>
         <td>String</td>
         <td></td>
         <td>"nft_url": "https://opensea.io/assets/matic/..."</td>

## Generic File Maker

[![Generic File Maker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91475935/166142331-6afe4920-f34a-47c1-9dfc-4e8ffd3ae57a.png)](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-generic-file)

With this OpenSea collection scraper, you can generate a whole file from a generic file or modify a file by replacing massively some values by others.  
You just have to fill a simple generic file with 21 details (18 for NFTs and 3 for formatting and file parameters) and run the script.  
Your file will be generated with common values for all your NFTs.  
It faciliates the creation of your metadata file.  
**Purchase this tool - [Generic File Maker](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-generic-file).**

<details>
  <summary>View this section.</summary>
  <br />

### Installation

* Extract the repository folder from the ZIP file, you should have a folder named `opensea-generic-file/`.
* Open a command prompt in the repository folder and type one of these commands (may require sudo on MacOS and Linux and administrator privileges for Windows):

  * ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  * ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  * ```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  * ```
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  * ```
    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
### Run the bot

* Open a command prompt in the `opensea-generic-file/` folder path and type one of these commands to run the bot:

  * ```
    python generic.py
    ```
  * ```
    python3 generic.py
    ```

### Changelog

* **Versions 1.3.0 to 1.3.2:**
  * Fixed recursion error when "Sale" option is selected.
  * Fixed `specific_buyer` value always set to `[true, ""]`.
* **Versions 1.2.0 to 1.2.2:**
  * Important fixes and improvements.
  * Added a start value for incrementing.
* **Version 1.1.0:**
  * Added support for preview file in the generic file.
  * Fixed the problem of unlockable content to false when set to true in the data file.
* **Version 1.0.0:**
  * Initial commit.

### How to complete the generic file?

* In the details part of the generic file, you have to complete with the value you want to put in your metadata file.

* What does the value "`incrementation`" mean?  
  You may have different file names, URLs or descriptions for each of your NFTs, so these details will be different for each NFT.
  * `number`: it will use a numeric value for incrementing (1, 2, 3, 4, etc).
  * ``letter``: it will use the alphabet for incrementing (`A` to `Z`, then `AA` to `AZ`, etc).
  
  **This value (number or letter) will be added wherever you place `{}` in your detail.**

* What does the "format" value mean?  
  This is the way `"increment": "number",` will work.
  * `0` : default value, numbers will be incremented in a basic way.
  * `-1`: it will add a specific number of digits depending on the number of NFTs (10000 NFTs ➜ `00001`, `00002`, etc).
  * Any strictly positive number: number of digits (3 digits ➜ `001`, ... `100`, etc).

* Settings part:
  * `overwrite`: it will overwrite the entire contents of a metadata file.
  * `overwrite_empty`: it will overwrite the details of a metadata file only if they are as default value.
  * `append`: it will append the value of any list of dictionary details (properties, levels, stats).

## Multiprocessing

[![Multiprocessing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91475935/166142605-8ce3d606-4b12-4b95-8f6d-20358dd41904.png)](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-multiprocessing)


With this Multiprocessing tool, you can upload and list your NFTs **two to five times faster**.
It splits your file into several subfiles, then command prompts open and work like the main bot but at the same time.  

Note: it requires a fairly powerful computer (a minimum of 6GB of RAM and a processor with a minimum of 2 cores).  
If your computer has some mismatch with the main bot, do not buy this tool.

**Purchase this tool - [Multiprocessing](https://maximedrn.gumroad.com/l/opensea-multiprocessing).**

<details>
  <summary>View this section.</summary>
  <br />

### Installation

* **Make sure you have version 1.7.10 or higher.**
* Extract the 2 files from the ZIP file, you should have a file named `multiprocessing.py` and another named `task.py`.
* Navigate to the "Upload and Sale" bot repository, and place these two files in the parent directory (`opensea-automatic-upload-and-sale/`).
  
### Run the bot

* Open a command prompt in the repository folder (same as the main bot) and type one of these commands to run the bot:

  * ```
    python multiprocessing.py
    ```
  * ```
    python3 multiprocess.py
    ```
* Select your choices as in the main bot.
* When two command prompts are open, you can close the `multiprocessing.py` tab.
* Now the bot runs multiple instances and upload/list or both your NFTs.

### Changelog

* **Version 1.1.0:**
  * You can now choose the amount of processes you want to run simultaneously (between 1 and 5).
  * Remove the output on save that make the process slower.
* **Version 1.0.0:**
  * Initial commit.

  * Removed unnecessary files from the `yolov5/` directory.
  * Fixed the problem of connection to OpenSea.

    ➜ Future improvements: models of crosswalks, chimneys, bridges.

### Version 1.5.12:
  * Wyvern 2.3 contract support (need feedbacks). **[#152](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/152), [#161](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/161), [#165](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/165)**. 

### Version 1.5.11:
  * <strike>Correction of the MetaMask contract signature (feedback needed).</strike> **[#144](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/144)**.
  * <strike>Wyvern 2.3 contract support (beta - need feedbacks).</strike> **[#152](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/152)**.

### Version 1.5.10:
  * Minor fixes concerning the `sale()` method of the OpenSea class.
  * Fixed exception iteration error.

### Version 1.5.9:
  * The `close()` method of the Webdriver class has been fixed. It creates an exception when listing NFTs. As a result, it does not try to list them a second time. **[#144](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/144), [#145](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/145), [#149](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/149)**.
  * During the download, when the webdriver starts, sometimes an error occurs and creates an exception. It was supposed to close the webdriver but it caused the bot to crash.
  * The download of webdriver requires a manual entry of the path after a number of failures.

### Version 1.5.8:
  * Errors related to incorrectly formatted files are now supported. An error is displayed but the bot does not stop abruptly. **[#90](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/90)**.
  * False listing errors are reduced, the robot checks a second time if the NFT is correctly listed.

### Version 1.5.7:
  * With each failed upload or sale, the bot retries a second time before saving the NFT data in an autogenerated file.
  * The duration has been fixed for GeckoDriver (Mozilla Firefox).  **[#121](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/121)**.

### Version 1.5.6:
  * The `dict_to_list()` method has been optimized and shortened.
  * Minor fixes.

### Version 1.5.5:
  * Fixed the `metamask_contract()` method. It was not signing the contract when completing the listing for the Ethereum Blockchain.
  * Minor fixes.

### Version 1.5.4:
  * The HTTPConnectionPool error in Selenium is fixed, it was caused by defining the driver inside a loop. Now the bot will print an error and restart to launch the bot. **[#112](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/112)**.  
    ➜ For more informations: **[Reddit - Ralphc360's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/cuynft/comment/f85odbh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**.
  * You can now sell your NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain for free.

### Version 1.5.3:
  * Fixed the Webdriver-Manager module, it was downloading the ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver at each webdriver launch. Now it uses the path of the downloaded webdriver. **[#112](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/112)**.
  * Fixed the collection input. **[#108](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/108)**.

### Version 1.5.2:
  * Headless mode support. Download Mozilla Firefox and you can use this bot in the background without any interface.
    Note: Firefox may be unstable and some features may work differently or not at all.  **[#64](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/64), [#69](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/discussions/69), [#106](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/106)**.
  * Fixed the connection to the MetaMask success indicator.

### Version 1.5.1:
  * Fixed the problem of the worker version 1.5.0. The bot now continues to upload and does not restart the upload from the beginning. **[#107](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/107)**.

### Version 1.5.0:
  * The reCAPTCHAs can now be bypassed. The bot restarts for each upload - it's a bit slow but it works. **[#98](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/98), [#102](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/pull/102)**.  
    Thanks to **[Kanishka-Chandra](https://github.com/Kanishka-Chandra)** and **[elwanm](https://github.com/elwanm)**.
  * The bot restarts after 3 failed connections to the wallet or to OpenSea.

### Version 1.4.9:
  * Minor fixes.
  * Developers can now add new wallets if they wish.
  * ChromeDriver is automatically downloaded - no need to do it manually (`pip install -r requirements.txt` required).
  * _The reCAPTCHAs solver is not integrated/configured._

### Version 1.4.8:
  * <strike>Added a new feature that allows to upload more than 50 items in a collection. Requires to be activated (asked at launch).</strike> (Method used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpmjh8xrXo). **Update:** This method is useless because [OpenSea went back on its words](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1486843201352716289). The limit has been removed.
  * Minor fix.

### Version 1.4.7:
  * The default language of ChromeDriver is now English to ensure maximum compatibility. The date did not work in some countries because of the different formats that OpenSea offers. **[#67](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/67)**.
  * Minor fix (Colorama module).

### Version 1.4.6:
  * The duration has been corrected. OpenSea does not allow to change the year when the next year is more than 6 months away. So it was impossible to enter the month without it being replaced by December (12 - maximum number because the year was entered instead); **Note: maximum duration is 6 months. [#55](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/55)**.
  * The connection to OpenSea has *certainly* been corrected. (need feedback about this - I don't have any problems on my side). **[#53](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/53), [#58](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/58), [#61](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/61)**.

### Version 1.4.5:
  * Minor fix for Linux users. The `clear_text(self)` method inserts an "A" when it tries to clear the inputs before sending the data. **[#39](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/39)**.

### Version 1.4.4:
  * Connection to OpenSea with MetaMask corrected. Download of the extension was requested. **[#53](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/53)**.
  * Connection to OpenSea with MetaMask improved.

### Version 1.4.3:
  * File preview is now added. **[#48](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/48)**.

### Version 1.4.2:
  * Listing of NFT on the Ethereum Blockchain is fully supported. **Be sure to make a deposit and have more than 0.05 ETH on your wallet.**

### Version 1.4.1:
  * Small fix for XLSX files. Empty cells were interpreted as "NaN", which is not interpreted as an empty string for Python. **[#18](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/18), [#23](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/23)**.

### Version 1.4.0:
  * You can now decide whether you want to upload or sell your NFTs, or both. **[#3](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/3), [#22](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/22)**.
  * Signing the MetaMask contract works every time. It can take 30 seconds to be signed when connecting to OpenSea. **[#5](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/5), [#17](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/17)**.
  * After uploading the NFT, the bot would crash when it tried to sell it (the URL was not correct). Now it doesn't. **[#17](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/17)**.
  * MacOS and Linux support improved.
  * Calendar method improved.

### Version 1.3.0:
  * Important fixes. **[#4](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/4), [#6](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/6), [#10](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/10), [#11](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/11), [#12](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/12), [#14](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/14)**.
